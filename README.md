## About

Linxz is an easy-to-use, self-hostable, and private link sharing platform. It provides a simple interface to shorten links and includes granular control over their experation. You can specify a date and time or a number of clicks until the link is deleted forever. Or, if you want it forever, that works too.

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)
1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following contents:
```yaml
name: linxz

services:
  linxz:
    image: ghcr.io/ngregrichardson/linxz:latest
    container_name: linxz
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 80:3000
    volumes:
      - linxz/linxz.db:/app/linxz.db
    environment:
      - BASE_URL

      # Uncomment the next line to specify a different local or remote database location
      # - DB_URL

      # Uncomment the next line to specify an authentication token for a remote database
      # - DB_AUTH_TOKEN

      # Uncomment the next two lines to use Cloudflare Turnstile
      # - NEXT_PUBLIC_CFTS_SITE_KEY
      # - CFTS_SECRET_KEY

volumes:
  linxz:
```

```
BASE_URL=http://localhost:80
```
2. Create a new volume with `docker volume create linxz`
3. Run `docker run --env-file .env -p 80:3000 -v hello/linxz.db:/app/linxz.db ghcr.io/ngregrichardson/linxz:latest --name linxz` to start the container
